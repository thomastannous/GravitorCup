# How to play

You can find the executable of the game already under `Build/GravitorCup.exe`.

You need at least two input devices (controller or keyboard) to play the game,
because AI isn't implemented yet.
If you use a Dualshock 4 (PS4 Controller), then the software 'DS4Windows' from
http://ds4windows.com/ is needed.
Start the game in 1v1 or 2v2 and let the players join by pressing the bottom face
button, i.e. 'a' on xbox and 'x' on ps4 or 'space' on keyboard. Then press 'play'.

The player can be move the gravitor with the left control stick or 'WASD'.
With right or left trigger (or on keyboard with space and ctrl) you can apply
"gravity" to the ball, but only when the ball is on your side of the field.
While applying gravity, the player can apply spin to the ball with the right
analogue stick or the arrow keys.

The goal is to let the ball stay a certain amount of time on the opponent's
side.

Have Fun! :)
